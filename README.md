# To-Do-List-Appplication
A React-based to-do list application that fetches data from an external API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Each to-do item is represented as a card with a border indicating its completion status: green for completed tasks and red for incomplete ones. The project demonstrates proficiency in using React hooks, specifically useState and useEffect, for managing state and side effects.
